                <h1>India Won WorldCup<span> 2024.</span></h1>
                <p>Suryakumar Yadav snatched a boundary catch for the ages, Jasprit Bumrah snuck in two electric final overs, and Hardik Pandya pilfered the two big wickets as India pulled off one of their great heists to win a World Cup, finally. With five overs to go, South Africa were rampant.

It was co-hosted by the West Indies and the United States from 1 to 29 June 2024; the tournament being hosted by the West Indies for the second time, while this was also the first major ICC tournament to feature matches played in the United States.The tournament field expanded from 16 to 20 teams, including the two hosts, the top eight teams from the 2022 edition, the best placed two teams in the ICC Men's T20I Team Rankings not already qualified, and eight other teams determined by regional qualifiers. Canada and Uganda qualified for the men's T20 World Cup for the first time, while the United States participated for the first time by virtue of being co-hosts.
                    England were the defending champions[1] and were beaten in the semi-finals by India, who went on to win their second T20 World Cup title, defeating South Africa by 7 runs and equalling England and West Indies with the most titles in the T20 World Cup.
